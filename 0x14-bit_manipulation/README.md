# **Bitwise operators**

& = Bitwise AND
| = Bitwise OR
^ = Bitwise XOR
~ = Bitwise complement
<< = Shift left
>> = Shift right

# **Bitwise AND Operatior &**

The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of 2 operands is 1. If either is 0, the result of the corresponding bit is 0

# **Bitwise OR Operator |**

The output of OR is 1 if at least one of teh corresponding bits is 1

# **Bitwise XOR Operator ^**

The result of XOR is 1 if the corresponding bits are opposite

# **Bitwise complement Operator ~**

This is a unary operator that changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
